    "about": "I'm a passionate Backend Engineer with a deep focus on building robust, scalable systems using Java and Spring Boot.\n\nMy journey in software development began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes. Over the years, I've honed my skills in designing RESTful APIs, microservices architecture, and database optimization.\n\nWhile my expertise lies in backend development, I'm constantly expanding my full-stack capabilities, exploring modern frontend frameworks and cloud technologies to deliver end-to-end solutions.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or writing technical articles to share knowledge with the developer community.",
